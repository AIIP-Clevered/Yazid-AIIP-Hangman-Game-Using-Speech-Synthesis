# Yazid-AIIP-Hangman-Game-Using-Speech-Synthesis

My project name is Hangman game.

It is a simple word guessing game where players try to figure out an unknown word by guessing letters. If too many letters which do not appear in the word are guessed, the player is hanged (and loses). 

In my game, I used speech synthesis 

So, playing the game will:- 
- Let us have fun while learning phonics and spelling at school 
- it will be suitable to blind persons using the speech synthesis
